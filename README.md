# RoadBlocker


An intelligent system to determine available routes in the event of flooding.

To be hosted on the cloud, accessed via app. 

Useful for rescue workers/evacuees. 

The system utilizes topograpgical map data, along with road maps and average rainfall values for a given radius to identify areas of water pooling on roads and thus leading to roadblocks. 

Ideally, would also include factors such as road usage, road age etc. to determine the resilience of the road to environmental factors, taking that into account. 

Futher expansion could include adding drainage maps into the algorithm to determine regions with poorest drainage and high flooding tendency to again predict the likely fooded routes.
