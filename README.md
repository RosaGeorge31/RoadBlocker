# RoadBlocker

We aim to build an intelligent system that will determine available routes in the event of flooding. We are planning to build an an app which is to be hosted on the cloud. 

This app would be really useful for rescue workers as well as those affected by the floods. 

## How we plan to build it

The system utilizes topograpgical map data, along with road maps and average rainfall values for a given radius to identify areas of water pooling on roads and thus leading to roadblocks. 

Ideally, would also include factors such as road usage, road age etc. to determine the resilience of the road to environmental factors, taking that into account. 

This way with the combination of the topographical map, layered with road map and rainfall value we will be able to predict whether the road is blocked or not and dislay the same on a map.

Futher expansion could be done by even considering drainage maps into the algorithm to determine regions with poorest drainage and high flooding tendency to again predict the likely fooded routes.
